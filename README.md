# 🔋 Smart Energy Optimization Model 🚀

## 📌 Overview
The **Smart Energy Optimization Model** is an AI-powered system that enhances energy efficiency in smart homes, offices, and industries. It integrates multiple AI agents to optimize power consumption, reduce costs, and promote sustainability.  

## 🌍 Problem Statement  
Traditional energy management systems suffer from inefficiencies, resulting in:  
- High energy costs due to unoptimized power usage.  
- Grid instability during peak demand hours.  
- Wastage of renewable energy due to improper storage and allocation.  
This project **addresses these challenges by applying AI-driven optimization techniques**.

## ⚡ Features  
✅ **AI-Based Energy Optimization** – Smart energy distribution to minimize waste.  
✅ **Demand Response Compliance** – Avoid peak-hour energy surcharges.  
✅ **Renewable Energy Utilization** – Efficient solar & wind energy integration.  
✅ **EV Charging Management** – Intelligent scheduling to prevent grid overload.  
✅ **Smart Lighting & HVAC** – AI-controlled automation based on occupancy.  
✅ **API-Based System** – Can be easily integrated into IoT devices and energy management systems.  

## 🏗️ System Architecture  
This model integrates **seven AI agents**, each handling different aspects of energy optimization:  
1️⃣ **Smart Lighting & HVAC Optimization**  
2️⃣ **EV Charging & Routing Optimization**  
3️⃣ **Renewable Energy Management**  
4️⃣ **AI-Driven Energy Audits**  
5️⃣ **Demand Response (DR) Systems**  
6️⃣ **Smart Home & Office Automation**  
7️⃣ **Grid & Battery Storage Optimization**  

The AI agents **send their energy consumption/supply data to a centralized optimization model**, which **uses mathematical optimization (SciPy) to distribute power efficiently**.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **FastAPI** – Backend for API communication  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **SciPy** – Optimization algorithms  
- **NumPy** – Data processing  
- **Machine Learning** – Energy forecasting & prediction models  
- **IoT Sensors (optional)** – For real-time energy tracking
